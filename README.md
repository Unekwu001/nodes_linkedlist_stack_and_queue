Week 2 - Task

Intro:

This task is aimed at evaluating your understanding of data organization, structuring and access.

Challenge

You are required to recreate the Generic classes for:

· Singly Linked list

· Stack

· Queue

Task Requirements

- All stories should be completed.

- Task should be submitted on or before Wednesday, 7th December 2022.

- Submission should be made to this GitHub classroom link: https://classroom.github.com/a/O-73wwoE

Functional Requirements

The Stack class should have the following methods

· IsEmpty() - returns true if the stack is empty and false is it isn’t

· Push(T item) – adds an item to the top of the stack

· Pop() – removes and returns the last item added to the stack

· Peek() - returns the last item added to the stack

· Size() - shows the number of items currently in the stack

The Queue class should have the following methods:

· IsEmpty() - returns true if the queue is empty and false is it isn’t

· Enqueue(T item) – adds an item to the tail of the queue

· Dequeue() - removes and returns the item at the head of the queue

· Size() - shows the number of items currently in the queue

The LinkedList class should have the following methods:

· Add(T item) - adds an item to the tail of the LinkedList and returns the linked list’s size

· Remove(T item) - removes the first occurrence of an item in the linked list, returns true if said item is found and removed or returns false otherwise

· Check(T item) - checks for a specified item in the linked list. Returns a Boolean

· Index(T item) - returns the index of an item or returns -1 if the item isn’t found

Marking Scheme

· Follow the Rubric Marking System

· Minus 5 marks for those who did not use LinkedList structure as the internal storage system for Stack and Queue
